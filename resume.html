                    <p>Within a year of completing my degree in Visual Communication Design from Cedarville University&#44; I began my career in design and marketing&#46; Hired by TANDEMKROSS in September 2019&#44; I was promoted from Graphic Designer to Marketing Associate in under a year&#46; In 2021&#44; I was promoted to Marketing Manager and again to Sales and Marketing Manager in 2023&#46;</p>
